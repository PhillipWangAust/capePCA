Distributed Differentially-private PCA (capePCA)
=====================================
This package includes Python implementation of  the capePCA algorithm that can achieve the same utility as the pooled-data scenario in an honest-but-curious model. Please see the original paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8509100 

* capePCA.py - the file contains a simple example with implementation of capePCA algorithm. It generates some synthetic data and performs the capePCA. It also computes the PCA subspaces using conventional distributed differentially-private scheme. Then it generates a plot of captured energy in the produced PCA subspace for different $$\epsilon$$ values.
